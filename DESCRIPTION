Description: Computes sequential A-, MV-, D- and E-optimal or near-optimal block and row-column designs for two-colour cDNA microarray experiments using the linear fixed effects and mixed effects models where the interest is in a comparison of all possible elementary treatment contrasts. The package also provides an optional method of using the graphical user interface (GUI) R package 'tcltk' to ensure that it is user friendly.
